# Spline

A spline is a piecewise polynomial function $S: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $n+1$ knots $t = [t_0, ..., t_m]$ where $a=t_0\le t_1 \le ... \le t_m=b$ and:

$$S(x) = P_i(x), \qquad t_i \le x \lt t_{i+1}$$

for $i=0,..,m-1$.

If the polynomial pieces $P_i$ each have degree at most $k$, then the spline is said to be of degree $k$ (or of order $k+1$).

## B-spline

A B-spline of order $k+1$ is a collection of piecewise polynomial functions $B_{i, k}(x)$ of degree $k$. B-splines are __basis functions__ for spline functions of the same order defined over the same knots, meaning that all possible spline functions can be built from a linear combination of B-splines, and there is only one unique combination for each spline function.

$$B_{i, 0}(x) = 1\qquad if~(t_i \le x \lt t_{i+1}),~o.w.~0$$

and recursively:

$$B_{i, k}(x) = \frac{x - t_i}{t_{i+k}-t_i}B_{i, k-1}(x) + \frac{t_{i+k+1} - x}{t_{i+k+1}-t_{i+1}}B_{i+1, k-1}(x)$$

## B-spline Curve

A B-spline curve is defined as a linear combination of B-spline basis functions with the knot vector $t = [t_0,..,t_k,..,t_n,..t_{n+k}]$ as $S: [t_k, t_n]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$:

$$S(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i B_{i, k}(x)$$
