# Spline

A spline is a piecewise polynomial function $S: [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ with $k+1$ __knots__ $(t_0, ..., t_k)$ where $a=t_0\le t_1 \le ... \le t_k=b$ and:

$$S(t) = P_i(t), \qquad t_i \le t \lt t_{i+1}$$

for $i=0,..,k-1$.

If the polynomial pieces $P_i$ each have degree at most $n$, then the spline is said to be of __degree â‰¤ n__ (or of __order n + 1__).

## B-spline

B-splines of order $n$ are basis functions for spline functions of the same order defined over the same knots, meaning that all possible spline functions can be built from a linear combination of B-splines, and there is only one unique combination for each spline function.
